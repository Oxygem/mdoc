mdoc is a (very) simple PHP powered markdown-powered documentation/wiki/website builder. Simply drop markdown files in the src/ directory and upload it. Designed for one man/small teams who prefer to organize in folders than via a web interface. Advise to use git for the src/ directory to manage history/etc.

Originally built to aid with documenting [Oxypanel](http://github.com/Oxygem/Oxypanel).
